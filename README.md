## Problem

```
Contemporary online review apps tend to follow an immutable review model, where posted consumer reviews do not reflect the current state of the point of interest, leading to stale reviews. Furthermore, these platforms tend to be unforgiving to businesses by allowing consumers to post misleading reviews even though those reviews might be unsupported and/or not verified by a larger audience. This problem diminishes the overall quality of the review platform.
```

## Solution 

```
To provide an alternative to the "immutable review" model, we have developed a mobile app that adopts the ephemeral review model where each review that is posted is assumed misleading, hence given a temporary time to live, unless supported by enough users to become a permanent review. When a review becomes permanent our platform gives to the original content creator points for providing a verifiable review about the place of interest.
